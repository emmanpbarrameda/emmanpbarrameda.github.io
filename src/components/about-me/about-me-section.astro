          My programming journey began when I was just <sb>16 years old</sb> as a Minecraft server owner. This experience ignited my interest in programming, and since then, I have been dedicated to studying the Java programming language. During my time at Vicente Madrigal Integrated School as a senior-high student, pursuing the TVL-ICT track, I excelled in Java Programming and was recognized as the
          <strong>Best in ICT Student</strong> in our batch upon graduation.
          <br /><br />Since then, I have been on an exciting freelancing journey that began during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown and continues until today, as <sb>I am still accepting clients</sb>.
          <br /><br />I have been offering my freelancing service to <strong>create desktop applications or web-based systems</strong>, catering to various needs such as thesis/capstone projects, company systems, and personalized tools.
          <br /><br />Currently, I am a <strong>graduating</strong> student pursuing a
          <sb>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</sb> at the
          <sb>University of Rizal System Binangonan</sb>. My studies revolve around Object Oriented Programming, Desktop Application Development, Graphic Designing and Web Development.
