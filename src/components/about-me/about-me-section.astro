          My programming journey began when I was just <sb>16 years old</sb> as a Minecraft server owner.
          This experience ignited my interest in programming, and since then, I have been dedicated to studying
          the Java programming language. During my time at Vicente Madrigal Integrated School as a senior-high
          student, pursuing the TVL-ICT track, I excelled in Java Programming and was recognized as the
          <strong>Best in ICT Student</strong> in our batch upon graduation.
          <br><br>Since then, I have been on an exciting freelancing journey that began during the 2020 Covid-19
          lockdown and continues until today, as <sb>I am still accepting clients</sb>.
          <br><br>I have been offering my freelancing service to <strong>create desktop applications or web-based systems</strong>,
          catering to various needs such as thesis/capstone projects, company systems, and personalized tools.
          <br><br>Currently, I am a <strong>graduating</strong> student pursuing a
          <sb>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</sb> at the
          <sb>University of Rizal System Binangonan</sb>. My studies revolve around Object Oriented Programming,
          Desktop Application Development, Graphic Designing and Web Development.
