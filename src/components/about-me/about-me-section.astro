      </h2>

      <!-- Intro / Teaser -->
      <p class="[&>strong]:font-bold">
        Hello world! I'm <strong>Emmanuel "Emman" P. Barrameda</strong>, a recent IT graduate from the Philippines with a strong focus on <u><strong>backend development</strong></u>. I bring over <strong>4 years of experience in desktop development</strong> and <strong>3 years in web development</strong>, with a solid foundation in Java and now specializing in the <strong>LAMP</strong> and <strong>TALL stacks</strong> using Laravel and Symfony.
        <br /><br />
        Passionate about programming since age 16, I continuously expand my knowledge through real-world projects, freelancing, and open-source contributions. I'm known for being <strong>innovative, dedicated, and detail-oriented</strong>, thriving in roles that involve leadership, project management, and mentoring.

          My programming journey began as a Minecraft server owner at 16, where I discovered my love for coding. I later pursued the TVL-ICT track in Senior High at Vicente Madrigal Integrated School and was awarded <strong>Best in ICT</strong> in our batch.
          <br /><br />
          In 2020, I began freelancing, i build desktop and web systems for academic and freelance use, including an <strong>Employee Management System for the Philippine Air Force</strong> and a <strong>Student Internship System</strong> for the University of Rizal System.
          <br /><br />
          Also, I completed my internship as a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> at Bapplware Technologies, Inc., where I developed structured RESTful APIs using <strong>PHP Symfony</strong>, incorporating timestamps, soft deletes, exception handling, and PHPUnit testing.
          <br /><br />
          Recently, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Information Technology (BSIT)</strong> from the <strong>University of Rizal System – Binangonan</strong>, where I also led various organizations, including serving as President of the <strong>BSIT Students’ League</strong>. Our capstone project, <strong>MMC MIS</strong>, was awarded <strong>Best Software Developmental Study</strong> during the 18th Research Congress.
          <br /><br />
          Now, I am continuously seeking opportunities for backend web-based projects, especially in the Laravel, Symfony, or FilamentPHP ecosystems.
