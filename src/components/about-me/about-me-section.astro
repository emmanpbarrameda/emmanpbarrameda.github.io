      <!-- Intro / Teaser -->
      <p class="[&>strong]:font-bold">
        Hello world! I'm <strong>Emmanuel "Emman" P. Barrameda</strong>, a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> from the Philippines specializing in the TALL Stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) and FilamentPHP. I build maintainable and scalable web-based systems for real-world use from client/freelance projects to corporate I've worked on.

        <br /><br />
        Passionate about programming since age 16, I continuously expand my knowledge through real-world projects, freelancing, and open-source contributions. I'm known for being <strong>innovative, dedicated, and detail-oriented</strong>, thriving in roles that involve development, leadership and project management.

          My programming journey started when I was running a Minecraft server at 16 — that’s where I first got curious about how systems work and how to customize them. I later took the TVL-ICT track in senior high at <strong>Vicente Madrigal Integrated School</strong> and was awarded <strong>Best in ICT</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          In 2020, I began doing freelance, where I developed both desktop and web systems. Some of the projects I delivered include an <strong>Employee Management System for the Philippine Air Force (HSSG)</strong> and a <strong>Student Internship System</strong> for the <strong>University of Rizal System</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          I also completed my internship as a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> at <strong>Bapplware Technologies, Inc.</strong>, where I built RESTful APIs using <strong>PHP Symfony</strong> and implemented timestamps, soft deletes, exception handling, and <strong>PHPUnit</strong> tests to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
          <br /><br />
          In June 2025, I completed my <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong> at the <strong>University of Rizal System – Binangonan</strong>, where I held leadership roles in three campus organizations — including serving as <strong>President of the BSIT Students’ League.</strong> Also Our capstone project, <strong>MMC MIS</strong>, was awarded <strong>Best Software Developmental Study</strong> during the URS Binangonan 18th Research Congress.
          <br /><br />
          Today, I work as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>, creating web-based systems with <strong>TALL Stack (Tailwind, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) and FilamentPHP.</strong> I also do freelance work and stay active in tech-communities like DevCon Manila and StudevPH to keep growing as a developer and leader.
